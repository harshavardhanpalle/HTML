    <b>Review: </b>
    <p>
        The story of a notorious criminal hunted by a dogged cop, who then goes on to replace the criminal with a look-alike and thereby infiltrate and bust the bad guys is a cinematic thread that has woven many box office success stories. Billa (Prabhas) is a Malaysia-based international gangster who is pursued by ACP Krishnamurthy (a badly cast Krishnam Raju). Mid-way through the 1st half, Krishnam Raju shoots down Billa and installs a look-alike, Ranga (Prabhas in a dual role) in his place. The rest of the story is about how Ranga manages to bust the gang and win his love. In between director Ramesh has interwoven a love story with Maya (Anushka) and Ranga. The Maya character was played by Priyanka Chopra in Farah & Shah Rukhâ€™s Don. Anushka though svelte is no match for the mercurial Priyanka. But she manages to hold her own. Prabhas as Billa struts like a model on a ramp in the 1st half of the movie. However as Ranga he shines as an actor and (barely) saves the movie.
